# COD Hardpoint Simulator - Secure Deployment Guide

## Overview

This project now includes a secure build system that properly handles sensitive configuration data through environment variables instead of hardcoded values.

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your actual Appwrite credentials:

```env
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_actual_database_id
APPWRITE_LEAGUES_COLLECTION_ID=your_actual_leagues_collection_id
APPWRITE_MEMBERS_COLLECTION_ID=your_actual_members_collection_id
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Check environment variables
npm run build:check

# Run security check
npm run security:check

# Build for production
npm run build

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean

# Serve locally for testing
npm run serve
```

### 3. Development Workflow

```bash
# Load environment variables and build
source .env.local && npm run build

# Or use a single command with inline variables
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1 \
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id \
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id \
APPWRITE_LEAGUES_COLLECTION_ID=your_leagues_collection_id \
APPWRITE_MEMBERS_COLLECTION_ID=your_members_collection_id \
npm run build
```

## Security Features

### ‚úÖ What's Been Secured

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive configuration moved to environment variables
2. **Build-time Injection**: Credentials are injected during build process, not hardcoded
3. **Security Checks**: Automated scanning for exposed credentials
4. **Secure Defaults**: Template files use placeholder values
5. **Gitignore Protection**: `.env.local` is excluded from version control

### üîí Security Validations

The build system includes several security checks:

- **Environment Validation**: Ensures all required variables are present
- **Credential Scanning**: Detects any exposed credentials in source code
- **Build Verification**: Confirms successful configuration injection

### üìÅ Build Output

The build process creates a `dist/` directory with:

- `index.html` - HTML file with injected configuration
- `config.js` - Configuration module
- `league.js` - Main game logic
- `Script.js` - Additional game scripts
- `styles.css` - Styling
- `images/` - Game assets

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended)

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the `dist/` folder to your hosting provider:
   - Netlify: Drag and drop the `dist` folder
   - Vercel: Deploy from the `dist` directory
   - GitHub Pages: Push `dist` contents to `gh-pages` branch
   - AWS S3: Upload `dist` contents to your S3 bucket

### Option 2: Server-Side Deployment

For server-side deployment, you can:

1. Set environment variables on your server
2. Run the build process on the server
3. Serve the `dist` directory with your web server

### Option 3: CI/CD Pipeline

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
        env:
          APPWRITE_ENDPOINT: ${{ secrets.APPWRITE_ENDPOINT }}
          APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID }}
          APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID: ${{ secrets.APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID }}
          APPWRITE_LEAGUES_COLLECTION_ID: ${{ secrets.APPWRITE_LEAGUES_COLLECTION_ID }}
          APPWRITE_MEMBERS_COLLECTION_ID: ${{ secrets.APPWRITE_MEMBERS_COLLECTION_ID }}
      - name: Deploy to hosting
        # Add your deployment steps here
```

## Security Best Practices

### üîê Credential Management

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use different credentials** for development and production
3. **Rotate credentials regularly** - Update them in your hosting platform
4. **Monitor API usage** - Check Appwrite logs for suspicious activity

### üõ°Ô∏è Appwrite Security

1. **Configure Security Rules**: Set up proper access controls in Appwrite
2. **Enable CORS**: Only allow your domain in Appwrite settings
3. **API Key Restrictions**: Limit API key permissions to minimum required
4. **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limits

### üåê Hosting Security

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always serve over secure connections
2. **Security Headers**: Configure CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
3. **Domain Verification**: Ensure your domain is properly configured
4. **Access Logs**: Monitor access patterns for anomalies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails with "Missing environment variables"**
   - Ensure all required variables are set in `.env.local`
   - Run `npm run build:check` to verify

2. **Security check fails**
   - Run `npm run security:check` to identify exposed credentials
   - Remove any hardcoded values from source files

3. **Configuration not working in browser**
   - Verify the build process completed successfully
   - Check browser console for configuration errors
   - Ensure Appwrite credentials are valid

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check environment variables
npm run build:check

# Scan for security issues
npm run security:check

# Verify build output
ls -la dist/

# Test locally
npm run serve
```
